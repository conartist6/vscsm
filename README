Welcome to the Very Simple Console Server Manager.
This is a work in progress, there is no clear way to compile it,
and although a functional version of the project exists somewhere,
I broke the code because it desparately needed massive reorganization.

The goal of this project is to provide a highly flexible application for managing console
servers online. While the project was started with the intent of facilitating the,
the execution and management of game servers like the source dedicated server, the project
is meant to be much more general purpose, and ought to evolve a bit along the lines of a web
version of the GNU screen utility. It eventually ought to support some sort of encryption
for client server communication.

The project is set up like so:

startserv:
This is the line server for the project. Its purpose is to start other server programs and 
collect their output. In the first draft of the project it functioned basically as an 
advanced script for starting a program, such that it was necessary to have a different 
binary for each server that was to be run. During the reorganization project the application 
has been modified so that one instance of the line server can (will be able to) start or
stop as many servers as the user wants. This simplifies communication with the web server 
significantly, requiring only one XmlHTTP request to get information about all the running
servers. Requires libconfig and libpthread.

web/index.php
The javascript in the index page is responsible for maintaining a system of objects 
representative or the running servers, crafting AJAX requests, and displaying the responses 
in an appropriate manner. It will also eventually have a configuration interface so that new
servers/sessions can be configured from the frontend instead of the backend. Some amount
of resource usage tracking has also been added to this page. Processor usage is currently
tracked for as many processors as the server has. Memory usage will come soon.
Requires JQuery and Flot.

web/srvcommand.php
Ajax page to construct requests to the line server. The format of these requests should be
something like for, say, for
Start the countersrike srouce server with name css
s@css
or to print new output from all servers
