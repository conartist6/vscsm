In order to use the VSCSM you will need the following:
Linux

The vscsm binary. It uses relative search paths to find its config just now. 

A configuration file, called vscsm.conf, in a location the server is configured to look for it.
	The general syntax for this config file is libconfig's. The possible options will be given
	in the vscsm.conf.example file.

A named fifo pipe, created with the mkfifo command, in the location specified in the config
	This pipe will need to be set up such that PHP has permissions to read and write to it.
	If PHP is running as an apache module this means that the apache user will need to have the perms.
	If PHP is configured not to be able to access files outside of hosted directories, the pipe will
	need to be in a hosted directory.
	Putting the pipe at /tmp/vscsm_fifo works fine for me.

A lock file. Nothing to do here except specify a path in the config.

PHP. The project was developed with PHP 5.2.14 running as an Apache module.

The vscsm website, located in the web folder, which can be symlinked or extracted into a web-accessible dir.

srvcommand.php (part of the site), configured with the path of the FIFO pipe.
	the srvcommand script does all the work of interacting with the named pipe.
	If the srvcommand script can't find a lock file indicating that the C portion of
	the application is running, it will return a 503.

If you have all these things in their configured locations and permissions set appropriately, it should work!
